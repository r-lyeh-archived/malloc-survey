Dumb TLSF

An extremely dumb memory allocator in the Two-Level Segregate Fit category.
This allocator keeps separate free lists for each size that it allocates.
Unlike most TLSF allocators, it makes absolutely no effort to combine adjacent
free blocks.

In other words, it's a hotrod pool allocator with mixed sizes and extra features.

Currently requires g++ and C++11.


Performance characteristics:

Tiny code size (< 10k compiled and optimized)
Blazingly fast realtime alloc and free (except when more memory needs to be reserved)
Even faster when sizes are known at compile-time (with optimization).
Excellent best-case fragmentation (constant + 0% overhead!)
Terrible worst-case fragmentation (almost unbounded)
Average-case fragmentation depends on how you use it.
No memory is automatically returned to the OS for other programs to use.


Usage:

 // Just dump this directly in your source tree.
#include "dumb_tlsf/dumb_tlsf.cpp"

 // All public functions are in the namespace dumb_tlsf.
using namespace dumb_tlsf;

template <class T>
T* dalloc ();
 // Allocate an object of type T.
template <class T>
void dfree (T*);
 // Free a previously allocated object of type T.
 // No error checking--freeing an object not allocated with dalloc() invites chaos.

template <class T, class... Args>
T* dnew (Args...);
 // Allocate an object of type T and call a constructor with arbitrary arguments.
template <class T>
void ddelete (T*);
 // Call the object's destructor and deallocate it.  Don't use this on polymorphic
 // pointers whose target may be larger than the pointer's official superclass.
template <class T>
void ddelete (T*, size_t);
 // Call the object's destructor and deallocate it, with the given size.

void* dalloc (size_t);
 // Allocate the given number of bytes.
void dfree (void*, size_t);
 // Free the given number of bytes.  Yes, you can use this to cut the end off of an
 // allocated object, provided you later free the object under its new smaller size.

void* dsalloc (size_t);
template <class T>
T* dsalloc ();
template <class T, class... Args>
T* dsnew (Args...);
void dsfree (void*);
template <class T>
void dsdelete (T*);
 // This set of functions stores the size of the object with the object, and frees it
 // based on that size.  This adds some time and space overhead, but provides
 // compatibility with malloc/free and new/delete.  Don't mix these with dalloc,
 // dfree, dnew, and ddelete.

struct _DS;
 // If you make a class inherit from this, you can use C++ new, new[], delete, and
 // delete[] syntax on it.  These will use dsalloc and dsfree.

void dreserve (size_t size);
 // Reserve the given amount of memory ahead of time.  This only works before
 // anything has been allocated or immediately after the dapocalypse; otherwise it is
 // a no-op.  Using this is not necessary, but is recommended if you want consistent
 // realtime performance.
void dset_alloc_size (size_t size);
 // From now on, whenever we run out of reserved memory, this much more memory will
 // be reserved.  The default alloc_size is one megabyte.  Try using dreserve
 // instead.

size_t dused_memory ();
 // Get the total amount of memory used by Dumb TLSF.  Includes fragmentation
 // overhead caused by freed-and-not-allocated chunks.  Does not include memory that
 // has been reserved but never allocated.  Before you release a major program
 // version, examine this after your program has been running for a while, and
 // dreserve a bit more than it.  This number only goes up, and never comes down.
size_t dallocated_memory ();
 // Like dused_memory, but doesn't include the two-word header per reservation unit.
 // Use this to detect leaks after you think you've freed everything manually.
size_t dreserved_memory ();
 // Get the total amount of memory reserved by Dumb TLSF, used or not.

void dapocalypse ();
 // Free all memory used by Dumb TLSF and start civilization anew.  Won't call
 // destructors.  Will probably return the memory to the OS.


Interface notes:

The file dumb_tlsf.cpp does not have an include guard, so you can include separate
copies in multiple namespaces.  This could be object-oriented, but that'd complicate
the interface.

Allocated chunks are aligned to 4 bytes under 32-bit and 8 bytes under 64-bit.

If the allocation fails or something, then probably NULL will be returned.  But if
that happens, you're probably screwed anyway.

If you define DUMB_TLSF_PROMISE_NO_OVERFLOW before including dumb_tlsf.cpp, you are
promising you will not exceed your reserved memory.  This may save a few cycles, but
you will probably segfault if you allocate beyond what you dreserved.  It's
probably not worth it.

If you define DUMB_TLSF_ALLOCATOR(size_t) and DUMB_TLSF_DEALLOCATOR(void*, size_t),
these will be used to reserve memory instead of malloc and free.

Usage recommendations:

Once you allocate a block of a certain size, that chunk of memory will always stay
the same size.  So, if your allocation sizes stay predictably similar over time, you
will enjoy efficient memory usage.  If your allocations vary wildly in size, you may
start to see problems.

In particular, if you allocate a number of objects of a certain size, then free them,
and never allocate anything of that size again, you will incur a memory leak equal in
size to the entire set of objects you allocated.  But if you allocate the same number
of those objects again, you will not use any additional memory.

So, this library is probably good for something like a video game, where realtime
performance is crucial, but the amount and kinds of allocations stay more or less the
same over time, and not so good for things like traditional string manipulation,
where elements of many different sizes are allocated.  But if your strings are
reference-counted ropes with fixed-size chunks, they would probably do very well with
this allocator.

Allocations larger than 7k fall through to malloc() and thus are not very realtime.
However, allocations that large probably mean you shouldn't be using Dumb TLSF in the
first place.
